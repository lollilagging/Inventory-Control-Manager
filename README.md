Sprint 1:
The initial Goal of Sprint 1 is to estbalish the structure of program. We did create an initial class diagram, but we knew that there as much more to the structure
as such our first official meeting was about building the new class diagram. We unfortunately loss the audio for the meeting but the actual class diagram itself will be seen in the link above.

Due to the amount of college requirements we had to do during the last week, we had to limit on what we can do. I started to project by initializing the object person. In the following days, I will be starting to work on other objects that fall under data structure together with Seth Dayao, whilst my other member, Jemuel will be working on the UI implementation of the program. On the following days, we will be focusing on the the objects and have a goal being able to test all objects on a unittest while my other member focus on the ui aspect of the program. 

The person object may now be able to accept different values and can now be integrated with a unittest
